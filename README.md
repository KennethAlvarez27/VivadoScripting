# Content

## Build Scripts
These scripts help to build Vivado/Sdk projects from python scripts. The interaction with Vivado/Sdk and all workarounds required are encapsulated in this Python module.

Details can be found [here](BuildScripts/README.md)

## ILA Parsers
These scripts parse data recorded with the Vivado Logic Analyzer for data that cannot easily be viewed in Vivado itself (e.g. I2C transactions).

Details can be found [here](IlaParsers/Readme.md)
